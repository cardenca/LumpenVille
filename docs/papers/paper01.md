The growth of the photovoltaic market has created the need for more intelligent, efficient and widely deployable maintenance, inspection and monitoring tools. In this context, innovations in the field of thermal inspection based on specialized cameras have undergone a substantial growth in both hardware and software. This method presents an advantage in terms of cost, deployability and efficiency. Indeed, it allows a close and reliable inspection of all photovoltaic installations.

Technical standardization and recent technological advances has accelerated the widespread adoption of infrared thermography (IRT) for PV diagnostics technology, particularly in drone-based and terrestrial (ground-based) IR imaging. Such inspection technology of PV systems can have a high spatial resolution of up to 25 pixels per solar cell, well beyond the minimum recommended value (3×3 pixels/cell) according to the IEC TS 62446-3 standard. Such high spatial pixel granularity allows for the diagnosis and classification of most failure modes at the PV plant level, down to the string, module and even cell level. As such, IR imaging diagnostics can be leveraged to identify the root cause of underperformance issues or PV failures, which often remain undetected or unidentified through standard PV plant monitoring.

Indeed, the thermographic inspection allows identifying many types of malfunctions of photovoltaic plants. It is a quick way to identify and remedy sources of loss. Nevertheless, the PV defect degradation over time in a PV module and its direct causes have been addressed in literature through I-V curves analysis and diagnosis. In this paper, we present an experimental study of this problem through the analysis of the thermal signature evolution in time. The main advance of this approach is the combination of thermal data and PV environmental data to tracking the spatio-temporal degradation of PV defaults and the direct impact on module performance.
