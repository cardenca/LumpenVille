Corresponding author: ioannis.tsanakas@cea.fr The growth of the photovoltaic market has created the need for more intelligent, efficient and widely deployable maintenance, inspection and monitoring tools. In this context, innovations in the field of thermal inspection based on specialized cameras have undergone a substantial growth in both hardware and software. This method presents an advantage in terms of cost, deployability and efficiency. Indeed, it allows a close and reliable inspection of all photovoltaic installations. Technical standardization and recent technological advances has accelerated the widespread adoption of infrared thermography (IRT) for PV diagnostics technology, particularly in drone-based and terrestrial (ground-based) IR imaging. Such inspection technology of PV systems can have a high spatial resolution of up to 25 pixels per solar cell, well beyond the minimum recommended value (3\u00d73 pixels/cell) according to the IEC TS 62446-3 standard. Such high spatial pixel granularity allows for the diagnosis and classification of most failure modes at the PV plant level, down to the string, module and even cell level. As such, IR imaging diagnostics can be leveraged to identify the root cause of underperformance issues or PV failures, which often remain undetected or unidentified through standard PV plant monitoring. Indeed, the thermographic inspection allows identifying many types of malfunctions of photovoltaic plants. It is a quick way to identify and remedy sources of loss. Nevertheless, the PV defect degradation over time in a PV module and its direct causes have been addressed in literature through I-V curves analysis and diagnosis. In this paper, we present an experimental study of this problem through the analysis of the thermal signature evolution in time. The main advance of this approach is the combination of thermal data and PV environmental data to tracking the spatio-temporal degradation of PV defaults and the direct impact on module performance.","title":"WCPEC-8-01"},{"location":"papers/paper01/#thermal-pv-defects-degradation-monitoring-using-a-mounted-thermal-camera","text":"September 20, 2022 | WCPEC-8 Authors: Dhia Eddine Melliti, Mohamed Amhal, and Duy-Long Ha.

Corresponding author: carlos.cardenas@cea.fr Several explanations have been proposed in the literature to represent defects in solar modules. However, despite the nature of the failure, the available data indicates that defects in a solar module can be modeled by modifying the internal parameters of the solar cells that compose the module. Consequently, having software capable of generating IV curves based on a distributed solar cell model represents an advantage for acquiring in-deep knowledge about the failure phenomena in solar modules. In addition, having access to such algorithms opens the possibility of creating new approaches, such as the generation of a thermal image based on the internal parameters of a solar module cell and environmental data (plane of array irradiance matrix, ambient temperature, and wind speed). There are different ways to calculate the electrical behavior of a solar module at different levels. One example of this is the well-known PVlib open-source library, which is capable of calculating atmospheric variables, as well as DC and AC electrical variables of large PV systems. This library offers the possibility of modifying the irradiance on the plane and the cell temperature assuming a uniform distribution. However, lacks the option of introducing mismatches in a solar array, which is a limiting factor when analyzing faulty scenarios. Therefore, specialized software is required to solve these cases. Another well-known and widely software used is PVmismatch. This software, as well as PVlib, is able to calculate IV curves at different levels of irradiation and cell temperatures for the distinct sections of a solar plant, i.e., solar cell, solar module, solar string, and solar system level. However, the advantage of PVmismatch is that the user can calculate IV curves when having different irradiances or cell temperatures at the cell level (for a solar module) or module level (for a solar string or solar system). This feature provides a degree of flexibility when studying the faults present in the solar system. Despite these advantages, PVmismatch is not capable of calculating atmospheric variables, or the AC generation of a photovoltaic system. Therefore, a complete analysis should be performed mixing both PVlib and PVmismatch libraries. This work proposes a novel calculus method that goes deeper into the nature of photovoltaic technology. For this purpose, a distributed solar cell model is used to calculate the IV curves of a solar module. The main advance of this approach is that the user can set the topology of the solar module, as well as each parameter of the solar cells that compose it. Also, the proposed calculus method offers the possibility of modifying the protection system model, adding another degree of freedom to the original problem. Finally, similarly to PVmismatch, the proposed method is able to calculate IV curves given the irradiance and cell temperature of each solar cell.","title":"WCPEC-8-02"},{"location":"papers/paper02/#computation-of-faulty-iv-curves-based-on-a-distributed-solar-cell-algorithm","text":"September 20, 2022 *Authors: Carlos C\u00e1rdenas-Bravo, Denys Dutykh, and Sylvain Lespinats Conference: 8th World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion, 26 \u2013 30 September 2022, Milan, Italy.
